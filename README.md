# trailerparkmod

Adds `trailer parks` to map generation, as well as regular and small trailers.

*Everything works?*
+ might play a little with the items that get spawned in the RVs
+ the monsters that spawn there probably need balancing
+ is that wall type okay for the shelter? i don't know if i like it
+ things should spawn in the dumpsters, but they don't yet
+ another version of the park with bandit fortifications and glass pits and stuff
+ how to basement? make one down from the shelter? it's a storage area? question mark?
+ bandits totally use the storage area for a makeshift prison
